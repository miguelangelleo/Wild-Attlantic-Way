    <h2><strong>Croithlí Distillery Experience, County Donegal</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Close to Ireland's prettiest airport and the steep peaks of Errigal, 
        at the base of which St Colmcille was distilling alcohol in 560 AD, 
        the Gaeltacht village of Croithlí houses <strong>Donegal’s</strong> first functioning licensed 
        whiskey distillery in 180 years. An Drioglann Chroithlí (The Crolly Distillery)
        is fully accessible and open daily with hourly tours. Learn about whiskey production past
        and present, taste new-make single malt with its Maillard effect flavour that comes from
        the distillery’s distinctive direct-fired Cognac stills, 
        and sample from their oak series experiments with mash bills and wood maturation.
