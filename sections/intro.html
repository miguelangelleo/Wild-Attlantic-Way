    <p class="introDesc">
        The Wild Atlantic Way route from start to finish unfolds the wonders of nature, the power of the ocean and its 
        imprint on the west coast of Ireland, and the stunning countryside in all its diversity. Enchanting 
        villages are nestled along the coast as well as ancient monuments - their origins having long sunk into the mists
        of oblivion dot the landscape. Behind every bend on this magical coastal road a new delight awaits.
